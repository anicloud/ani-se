The AniQ Search Engine
====

AniQ is a category-driven search engine system for structured data developed by Anicloud Limited. The system provides an portal service for indexing the structured information of different categories. AniQ is consisted by a 4-layer query utilities stack(top-down approach):

1. **Semactics detection**: for narrowing the range of categories based on the sematic of query explanation and user behavior data;
2. **Searching functions implemention of specific categories**: impletation of the next layer for one single category.
3. **Unified searching functions framework**: provides a standardized service of utilities library and searching pipeline for constructing a vertical search impletation of one single category.
