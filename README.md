1. **Searching intention detection**: for narrowing the range of categories based on the sematic of explanation and user behavior data;
2. **Searching functions implemention of one category**: impletation of the next layer for one single category.
3. **Unified searching functions framework**: provides a standardized service of utilities library and searching pipeline for constructing a vertical search impletation of one single category.
